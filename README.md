# ChimeCandy-Grid
Pre beta music ed project 

ChimeCandy is a music app created with the idea of jumpstarting a child's education in music. Our goal is for this app to be used by children everywhere in order for the love of music to be a main focus in a child's early development. 

Our vision for the app is to make a tile grid in unity and create a music staff along with having a note area to where the user can drag the note onto the grid (staff). When the note is released onto the staff, based off of what key the note is in the note will change to a specific color and image (Ex: key B for a Blue Balloon)
